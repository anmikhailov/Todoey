## About this app
This is a todolist app to keep track of all your tasks. The app allows you to create a to-do list, sort them into categories, search the list. The application saves data using Local data storage.
##### In this app I use:
* UIKit/programmatically layout.
* TableView Delegates
* Core Data.
* Singleton.
* CustomCell using SwipeCellKit.
* Chameleon framework (using Cocoapods).
